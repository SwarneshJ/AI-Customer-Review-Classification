# AI-Customer-Review-Classification
A business-grade text classification system that transforms unstructured customer reviews into structured, decision-ready insights. Designed a theoretically grounded label schema identifying key customer issue types (delivery, product quality, billing/refund, service experience, and usability).

**Key contributions**:
• Created a detailed labeling codebook with definitions, examples, and edge-case rules
• Collected and cleaned 16,000+ reviews from public datasets (Amazon & Yelp)
• Benchmarked 6+ generative AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, xAI) for labeling accuracy, cost, and reproducibility
• Fine-tuned a RoBERTa classifier using 15K labeled samples, achieving >0.80 macro-F1 on a human-labeled triple-annotated holdout set
• Conducted error analysis and built an evaluation framework with MCC, F1, AUC metrics
• Delivered an executive-style business memo outlining ROI, operational value, deployment strategy, and limitations
