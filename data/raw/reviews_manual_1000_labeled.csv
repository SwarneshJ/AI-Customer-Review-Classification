12/18/21 18:55,"I had stopped using Grubhub for awhile because of all sorts of issues with their workers. I live in an apartment that is inside a family house and drivers would continuously deliver the food to the family instead of me. It got to the point where I started saying in the notes ""I will be standing outside with a flashlight, please hand it to me"" and they would still just leave it on the front step. I came back to order something strictly for the Endwalker Promotion - Not only was the food horribly overpriced, the fees and taxes and everything were HUGE. Again, I specified that I would be standing outside with a flashlight and the driver instead went straight to the front door and started knocking - even after I called out to him 4 times, I finally had to shine the flashlight in his face. The drivers NEVER read the instructions. And now customer service is telling me they can't answer my question about where my Endwalker code is. All of the customer service people I have spoken with have stated that the code was applied to the order correctly, however they have not given me a clear answer either way about whether I was going to receive the code. TLDR: No one bothers to read what you write in the notes (drivers nor customer service reps) and the service is way too overpriced.
