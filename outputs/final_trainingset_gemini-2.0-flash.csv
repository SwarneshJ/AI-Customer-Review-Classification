10/12/20 5:00,For those of you who feel entitled because you are giving a tip. Even the smallest tip is being used by grubhub ( & all apps) as part of payment which ends ups amounting to less than minimum wage per hour after expenses and taxes. (Who actually knows how much tips these companies keep) So don't expect that we are going to go over our limits to deliver your food. You will get what you ordered if you don't expose the delivery personnel to risks. If not you will have to pick it up in the streets.,Delivery Issue

Grubhub refunds me for the missing items again, but that still leaves the $5 tip, the $5 delivery fee, and the taxes on a $40 order. We paid ~$15 for a flavored water.

My latest experience with GH - I order several entrees from a nice Italian restaurant, even though they weren't GH+ (meaning I had to pay more for fees, etc). Get the food - the order is totally wrong with just a passing resemblance of what I ordered. To confuse things even more, the receipt with the order matched the food, but was less than 50% accurate to the order I could see I made on my phone. So I call the restaurant to see what happened. The person who answered the phone knew who I was and knew about the order. She explained to me that the order was phoned in by someone with ""a very strong accent"". She had a difficult time understanding the person. The name of the pizza I ordered was a ""Shawnza"". He couldn't convey this in a way that the person taking the order could understand and told her to ""just skip it"". Then on other items when she tried to clarify (and interpreted what he said poorly, he told her, ""that's ok"" even though it didn't match what was ordered. The restaurant person conveyed that it didn't appear that he was even looking at the restaurants menu and didn't know what the meal options were. So I get ahold of Grubhub on chat (the only way I could see to reach them) and explained the problem and what their part was in the problem. They offered to not charge me for the missing items. So big of them. I told them, ""If that's what I wanted, I could have done that online via the order. This was supposed to be a nice meal and it's ruined - I want you to refund my order."" (My monthly quota for being a 'Karen'). He checked with his supervisor who told him, ""no"". Even though they refunded 1/2 the order, they only refunded 2 dollars of the fees.

10/15/22 19:11,May I make a suggestion? Maybe have the driver doublecheck items ordered against the receipt before they leave the restaurant. I was told it's not the driver's responsibility to make sure they are handed the correct items. Can the driver not take a step further to ensure they are handed the correct items or is that too much to ask? This happens way too often for the amount of money spent. Can I get my tip back since I didn't get all I ordered because the driver couldnt be bothered to check???,Order Accuracy

The common promotions slowly disappeared and when they do come they appear via push service only. If you don't immediately order or take a screenshot of the code it disappears for good. Here's the best part: the offer says $5 off a $10+ order, for example, but when you try to order the minimum is actually $30. This happened to me two days in a row. Other times, the code simply didn't work, no reason given. If you have the patience to argue back and forth with Grubhub (which can only be done via Twitter now) you'll eventually miss the delivery window anyway.

7/11/20 4:26,"Grubhub has really gone downhill since the pandemic started. I recently ordered from a local chain restaurant that had a banner that stated I would get free delivery for orders over $15.00, which would have the delivery fee removed during checkout. Went through checkout only to be charged the delivery fee. I chatted with Grubhub and they stated, after I had to send them a screenshot of their own website showing the promotion, that they would refund me the delivery fee of $4.99. Turns out they refunded me $4.59 and applicable tax, which comes out to $4.97. Fine, whatever, close enough. Next, on the same order, I was to have the order delivered by 7:45 pm that night. I watched how my order was accepted by a driver at 6:54 pm. I then got to watch the driver go near the restaurant, not get my order, drive to three separate stops, and then by 8:45 she finally gets to the restaurant and I receive my cold, hardened food by 9:00 pm. I attempt to go back into the app to reach out to Grubhub again, but once you get one measly service request fulfilled, you're screwed on receiving any future service. So, I call and reach their ""customer service"", which was just a kid saying, ""Sometimes order times change"". Yes, I agree, but when I can literally watch the driver bypass the restaurant three times only to finally go get the food once I text message her, to which she says ""it'll be five minutes,"" which really meant it took an hour, maybe the customer is correct that something went awry with your app? Overall, when I eventually got my food, the chicken was hard, cold, and congealed. But sure, maybe the restaurant waited until the driver got there to make the food and it just hardened within 15 minutes. What did I do to attempt to make this right? I was able to reach a chat agent again by going to another previous order, pressing the get help button, and then putting the order number into that chat. That's the workaround to their crappy app. Anyway, after explaining to them what had occurred the night before they said, ""Here's a 20% coupon for your next order"". I was then asked, ""Do you want to receive your food or just get a refund."" I wanted some sort of reconciliation, but, alas, that would have been too much for the 18 year old attempting to hand out customer service for a billion dollar company. Thanks for not listening to my request for some small refund, but whatever I took it because that led me up to tonight, 7/10/20. I used that 20% coupon on a local Mexican restaurant. I ordered 5 hours ahead to make sure there were no issues. Well, of course there was an issue. Did you know when you order 3 rolled tacos from Roberto's Taco Shop on any other app or in person they ask you what type of meat you would like in it? Grubhub's app does not, so I was informed I would just get 3 fried tortillas covered in guacamole. YUM!!! That sounds... well, dumb. Why would you call it a rolled taco in the app without any option to choose a choice of meat? Anyway, the driver gave impeccable service and had them remake my 3 orders of 3 rolled tacos. But guess what!?!?! The restaurant straight up didn't give me any of them. Fortunately, requesting a refund through the help option was easy without any questions asked. Overall, Grubhub is a junk delivery service now. There is active listening by any of the customer service reps; they only listed to respond, not to assist. Their app also lacks basic services such as picking meats that are supposed to go into items or restaurant promotions that are supposed to be added immediately, such as free delivery or a buy one get one free option. Use any other delivery service instead as you will find Grubhub is more of a nuisance than a well-rounded paid-for service.",Delivery Issue

I called the restaurant only to find out my order has been ready and waiting for pick-up for over an hour. When I called grub hub they tried to blame the restaurant and the best they could do was just say sorry. I will not be using this service again...if you want to use a delivery service go with door dash!!!,Delivery Issue
6/20/21 17:04,Several times my order was either not delivered or delivered to the wrong house and I have to go on an hunt to find where it is. There is no repercussions for drivers so they just drop it off wherever then leave. If you look for a way to review them there isn't one.

2/4/23 23:03,Grub hub let's drivers see your tip before a delivery meaning they can just ignore you. And even if you give a good tip before the delivery their drivers will still do a bad job half the time. The customer service is also really bad with helping you out on comparison to doordash.
