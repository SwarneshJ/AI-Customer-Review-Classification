I came back to order something strictly for the Endwalker Promotion - Not only was the food horribly overpriced, the fees and taxes and everything were HUGE. Again, I specified that I would be standing outside with a flashlight and the driver instead went straight to the front door and started knocking - even after I called out to him 4 times, I finally had to shine the flashlight in his face. The drivers NEVER read the instructions. And now customer service is telling me they can't answer my question about where my Endwalker code is. All of the customer service people I have spoken with have stated that the code was applied to the order correctly, however they have not given me a clear answer either way about whether I was going to receive the code.

5/20/23 1:43,delivery fee is so high,Price / Cost Complaint
12/28/21 18:36,Food gets delivered to the wrong house.,Delivery Issue
7/16/20 5:40,Ridiculous fees! A $30 order ended up being $42 after all the fees were added.... and the crazy thing is they had the same items for cheaper on DoorDash with less fees! Waited an hour just for them to cancel my order.,Price / Cost Complaint
9/18/21 0:21,"This delivery is by far the worst I have ever experienced with a food app. They get my orders wrong constantly, my food is NEVER on time IF i even get it at all, I've met plenty of rude delivery people and sometimes my food will not even be what I ordered. They refund my orders when they can't get anything done, and the worst part is I can recall a couple of times where I didn't even get my money back. So if you want a good food delivery app, don't chose grubhub...its absolute garbage.",Order Accuracy
9/14/22 6:50,"Terrible service, every order has been delayed from 30min to an hour and half. Driver's do not respond to messages and you end up with cold food every time. That's the GrubHub guarantee.",Delivery Issue
4/25/22 3:19,Way too many late orders. Had one order never show. A service fee on anything and everything even with GH+. Cannot recommend. (App does look nice.) They did give a discount code on a future order... but who wants to chain code after code? I just want my food hot.,Delivery Issue

8/30/20 15:09,"Steals money from local establishments and extorts them for business. Call your local eateries directly and go pick it up yourself, and gives it to other people who did not even ask that item.",Others
3/31/23 21:15,"Delivery drivers never knock, steal my food and when it was delivered, it was always cold becuase they take too long. Doordash treats you better.",Delivery Issue
11/8/20 4:05,One thing I like is that this food delivery service does not upcharge the food like doordash. The down side is they have drivers that can not seem to make sure they have delivered the food at the correct address.,Delivery Issue
5/19/22 14:35,"I literally can't ever order. The app crashes or it never accepts my payment methods. Also once I get to the payments screen it'll say items not available, or some other reason why I can't order.",App Bugs / Payment Issue

3/23/21 17:54,Too many fees. Subtotal came to 37 grand total $54. And I had the GH+. Not worth it.,Price / Cost Complaint
5/2/21 16:02,"Seriously don't even waist your time with this garbage. I've given way too many chances and have been highly disappointed with my results, mainly the fact that they change delivery times at least twice every order. Or even better! My food never leaves the restaurant I have to go get it myself. At least customer service is top notch.",Delivery Issue

8/1/20 5:26,"Glitchy, messy, never seems to work. Pauses forever on payment page, promo codes don't work, lose progress on order and have to restart. Most importantly GH is a lot slower of a service than other comparable apps, both in terms of drivers and customer service when trying to get a refund for the inevitably cold and ruined food.",App Bugs / Payment Issue
2/21/21 4:16,"The restaurant messed up pretty bad. Your app lets you file complaints about your order which I did. The next screen that was presented showed my menu item with 2.02$ next to it. With no prompt on what this even meant my choices were"" back or next"". I hit next and apparently that was the refund I had just accepted. Tried to live chat an agent and that chat was ended",App Bugs / Payment Issue
