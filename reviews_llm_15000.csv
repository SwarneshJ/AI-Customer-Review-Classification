It is hard to get a supervisor to help you. Plus after 10 pm there are no supervisor working. What ever you do don't use this company!!!!!!!!!!,1,MICHAEL ANTHONY MASEN,Grubhub,Google Play

2020-10-03 02:44:43,I've had nothing but issues with this company. To the point where I stopped using them. 1st time the gentleman was 60 min LATE (past the wait time) then when we didn't tip him he lost his cool and banished a pistol so we called the cops to make him leave. So then we didn't use the app for a few months and then after 2 months we used it. The very first time we used it after waiting almost 45 minutes they told us out order was canceled and issued a refund with no reason why. Use a different app!!,1,Aaron Krueger,Grubhub,Google Play

I consider GrubHub did nothing but delaying my meal. I tried to contact them and never got help and I wasted my time looking for a cancellation option that I couldn't find. I will be yet more disappointed if they charge me their application and delivery fees. I'll wait for my final check and see.

Grubhub was actually kind in giving me a full refund; what spoiled things is that they put a hold on my account so I couldn't order any more food. Judging by all the one star reviews flooding the app's store page, I think it's safe to say the app is in an even worse place than when I last used it.

Possibly because it is run by some DimWitt, who at best could be described as a bald malnourished alien, that is more concerned about shareholders than providing a good service.

All the other food delivery services did the same which is why I opted to use the one standout grubhub.

I specifically said ring the doorbell before placing the box of pizza on the porch and call instead of text when he delivers. The driver didn't call and he didn't ring the doorbell. So my pizza was out in a storm for over 40 mins. I contacted GrubHub and they told me the best they could do was give me 20% off then they changed it to 25% and told me thats the best they could do. So I'm done with them. Wet pizza,1,Orpheus Walker,Grubhub,Google Play

The fast food places are more than a half hour drive away, so I order through the app. Every time I order, it arrives late and I cannot eat my food. I have tried ordering as early as 10:00 am. My food never arrives before 12:30, which is the end of my lunch period. And it is too hard to get a refund because the person who answers when I call just screams and does not understand what I am saying.",1,Kayden McKinstry,Grubhub,Google Play

2022-11-14 06:33:43,"Worked great until the last update. Apparently every single restaurant has paused delivery according to this app. However if you call the restaurants, they are accepting orders. I have never canceled an order, and have never had an order canceled so there's no reason why deliveries should be paused. Glad I got my account free, I sure wouldn't pay for this. I've also noticed that my orders consistently are more than the order total given with no explanation why.",1,Mys Katt,Grubhub,Google Play
2021-01-20 09:23:34,Imagine waiting 2 hours for you food... Very dissapointed. Atleast the food was pretty good and the driver was cool and actually delivered the order think this was an app problem for sure. Never using this app again,1,DANK & DABBY,Grubhub,Google Play
2021-09-24 01:02:29,"The app itself is alright and the prices are cheaper than Uber Eats, but you definitely get what you pay for. I've rarely had a driver that reads my instructions for delivery correctly, delivers to the correct location, or delivers on time. It's cheap, but be prepared to have your food delivered to you later than you'd like. My most recent delivery guy that made me uninstall the app brought me the completely wrong order. And since I can't find a place to review the drivers, I'm blaming the app.",1,Kenny Nixon,Grubhub,Google Play
2022-02-12 19:16:34,"With the fat stacks GrubHub has made exploiting every restaurant in the country during the pandemic, they could at least fix all the bugs in the app. No other delivery has this issue where if you leave something in your cart and leave the app, everything either disappears or breaks, saying the restaurant doesn't have those items anymore (which is indeed a bug, the items are still available) but it won't even let you clear your cart to re-order.",1,Briar Bat,Grubhub,Google Play

I placed my first order and watched as the driver arrived at the restaurant to pick up my food, only to have my order cancelled with zero explanation. When I reached out to customer care to find out why, they essentially gave no information.

My Prime membership was renewed in May so I know it's still active and they tried to tell me it was because I cancelled the auto renew which I did not. Now I'm unable to link my Prime and GrubHub account again so needless to say I will not be using the app again.

2022-01-03 05:27:28,The drivers were not an issue nor was the money paid for them to deliver. My issue is the taxes paid on the app as the app is based in Illinois with high taxes.

Not only had they not started on the order yet, but they were happy to cancel an order that I did not want. Now, why couldn't the rep have done the same exact thing! Why do I have to do Grubhubs job!

Of course they don't warn you about this so you have to wait 30m or more to find out your food isn't coming. The app is much harder to use than door dash.

Somehow I get a Dr. Pepper. I didn't complain, it wasn't worth it. 2) Burger King - I ordered 2 meals and a kids meal. I got 1 meal....they refunded me for the missing items but i still paid taxes and a tip percentage based on my original order. I stopped using grubhub for the longest time because of this. Today, however, my wife wanted Dunkin Donuts. So she sent me her grubhub order and I thought I'd give it one more chance. 3) Dunkin Donuts - we ordered 1/2 dozen donuts, 2 breakfast sandwiches, and a coollatta drink. Basically a $40 order after all the fees. We get the delivery and it's just the drink (which tastes like piss water). A $3 drink. Grubhub refunds me for the missing items again, but that still leaves the $5 tip, the $5 delivery fee, and the taxes on a $40 order. We paid ~$15 for a flavored water.

They offer a free $10 meal as part of the membership, and then the $10 meal just doesn't show up and there's no info about how to claim it.

2020-10-22 05:29:06,"This service sucks as a meal deliver service. You'll do better to use one of the other two popular ones. My latest experience with GH - I order several entrees from a nice Italian restaurant, even though they weren't GH+ (meaning I had to pay more for fees, etc). Get the food - the order is totally wrong with just a passing resemblance of what I ordered. To confuse things even more, the receipt with the order matched the food, but was less than 50% accurate to the order I could see I made on my phone. So I call the restaurant to see what happened. The person who answered the phone knew who I was and knew about the order. She explained to me that the order was phoned in by someone with ""a very strong accent"". She had a difficult time understanding the person. The name of the pizza I ordered was a ""Shawnza"". He couldn't convey this in a way that the person taking the order could understand and told her to ""just skip it"". Then on other items when she tried to clarify (and interpreted what he said poorly, he told her, ""that's ok"" even though it didn't match what was ordered. The restaurant person conveyed that it didn't appear that he was even looking at the restaurants menu and didn't know what the meal options were. So I get ahold of Grubhub on chat (the only way I could see to reach them) and explained the problem and what their part was in the problem. They offered to not charge me for the missing items. So big of them. I told them, ""If that's what I wanted, I could have done that online via the order. This was supposed to be a nice meal and it's ruined - I want you to refund my order."" (My monthly quota for being a 'Karen'). He checked with his supervisor who told him, ""no"". Even though they refunded 1/2 the order, they only refunded 2 dollars of the fees. The fees and driver tip ended up being 10 dollars more than the food price. I won't be ordering from GrubHub again, and thought others should know that this high-tech service isn't very high-tech and doesn't care about getting your order wrong.",1,Sean Keef,Grubhub,Google Play

Another item came and driver was forthright but but the restaurant couldn't even deliver on its end.

I got 20 bucks off and paid 15 dollars worth of fees even with the subscription. This is insane.

2023-03-18 03:41:43,I live in a populous suburb. GrubHub delivery speeds are a joke due to their poor practice of allowing drivers to take or assigning as many orders as they want to one driver. I place an order and the driver gets more locations and my order gets sorted to the last delivered more often than not. My cooked food never arrives hot and my cold food never arrives cold. Usually some lukewarm temperature from the driver's vehicle. Others svcs may cost more but the quality of svc & reliability are better.,1,Ryan Orme,Grubhub,Google Play

I was an evaluator for about a year so I was forced to order from Grubhub and paid to do reviews of their service. So I often was paid to order 4-5 times a week. Invariably my orders would be late, and cold. In addition the food was often no appetizing due to long delays on the part of Grubhub.

As long as he delivers my food in the final couple of minutes (post 'your order has been delayed and delivery time has been updated') then GH customer service won't flag him. This is after they've previously refunded an order from the same driver and given me two months of premium. Now that it's happened again and the driver is ""unreachable"" they treat me like a nuisance and are unwilling to help. The fact is, no matter how wonderful the restaurant may be, GH is not committed to holding their drivers accountable. As a result, the food is often underwhelming (read: cold) and the customer has to accept GH's shady delivery practices. I just hope that as we learn to live with this ""new normal,"" people can go back to dining in to support their favorite restaurants. Per GH's review guidelines: Few words aren't helpful for other diners and rambling for paragraphs will be overlooked. I suppose my rambling will just be overlooked.

Customer service never responded. And the next day they sent a notice of changes to Terms & Service... (As of 12/14) Terms of Service, GrubHub has magically erased your right to arbitration and class action for any transaction, ever, and you agree to this change because hey, they sent you a notice about it less than 24-hours until it takes effect, and well, you're still using the app so OBVIOUSLY you consent to these shenanigans...

Ever since they merged and the logos and apps became identical the service disintegrated and the prices keep rising. The common promotions slowly disappeared and when they do come they appear via push service only. If you don't immediately order or take a screenshot of the code it disappears for good. Here's the best part: the offer says $5 off a $10+ order, for example, but when you try to order the minimum is actually $30. This happened to me two days in a row. Other times, the code simply didn't work, no reason given. If you have the patience to argue back and forth with Grubhub (which can only be done via Twitter now) you'll eventually miss the delivery window anyway.

2020-07-11 04:26:04,"Grubhub has really gone downhill since the pandemic started. I recently ordered from a local chain restaurant that had a banner that stated I would get free delivery for orders over $15.00, which would have the delivery fee removed during checkout. Went through checkout only to be charged the delivery fee. I chatted with Grubhub and they stated, after I had to send them a screenshot of their own website showing the promotion, that they would refund me the delivery fee of $4.99. Turns out they refunded me $4.59 and applicable tax, which comes out to $4.97. Fine, whatever, close enough. Next, on the same order, I was to have the order delivered by 7:45 pm that night. I watched how my order was accepted by a driver at 6:54 pm. I then got to watch the driver go near the restaurant, not get my order, drive to three separate stops, and then by 8:45 she finally gets to the restaurant and I receive my cold, hardened food by 9:00 pm. I attempt to go back into the app to reach out to Grubhub again, but once you get one measly service request fulfilled, you're screwed on receiving any future service. So, I call and reach their ""customer service"", which was just a kid saying, ""Sometimes order times change"". Yes, I agree, but when I can literally watch the driver bypass the restaurant three times only to finally go get the food once I text message her, to which she says ""it'll be five minutes,"" which really meant it took an hour, maybe the customer is correct that something went awry with your app? Overall, when I eventually got my food, the chicken was hard, cold, and congealed. But sure, maybe the restaurant waited until the driver got there to make the food and it just hardened within 15 minutes. What did I do to attempt to make this right? I was able to reach a chat agent again by going to another previous order, pressing the get help button, and then putting the order number into that chat. That's the workaround to their crappy app. Anyway, after explaining to them what had occurred the night before they said, ""Here's a 20% coupon for your next order"". I was then asked, ""Do you want to receive your food or just get a refund."" I wanted some sort of reconciliation, but, alas, that would have been too much for the 18 year old attempting to hand out customer service for a billion dollar company. Thanks for not listening to my request for some small refund, but whatever I took it because that led me up to tonight, 7/10/20. I used that 20% coupon on a local Mexican restaurant. I ordered 5 hours ahead to make sure there were no issues. Well, of course there was an issue. Did you know when you order 3 rolled tacos from Roberto's Taco Shop on any other app or in person they ask you what type of meat you would like in it? Grubhub's app does not, so I was informed I would just get 3 fried tortillas covered in guacamole. YUM!!! That sounds... well, dumb. Why would you call it a rolled taco in the app without any option to choose a choice of meat? Anyway, the driver gave impeccable service and had them remake my 3 orders of 3 rolled tacos. But guess what!?!?! The restaurant straight up didn't give me any of them. Fortunately, requesting a refund through the help option was easy without any questions asked. Overall, Grubhub is a junk delivery service now. There is active listening by any of the customer service reps; they only listed to respond, not to assist. Their app also lacks basic services such as picking meats that are supposed to go into items or restaurant promotions that are supposed to be added immediately, such as free delivery or a buy one get one free option. Use any other delivery service instead as you will find Grubhub is more of a nuisance than a well-rounded paid-for service.",1,Nicolas,Grubhub,Google Play

No, drivers are tied to an acceptance rate that is so stringent they can't qualify for hourly min and schedule. If your driver requests a larger tip, don't be a ghoul.",1,T La,Grubhub,Google Play

If you order something for $9 your order is going to be between $25-$30. I ordered a meal for delivery and needed to cancel it because it was being delivered to the wrong address even though my address in the system was correct.

I have video proof of this. The previous delivery guy. Spilled the entire contents of a 19 dollar pho soup. Grubhub won't refund claiming a abuse of refund policy. Stay away,1,A. T.
